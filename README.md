## ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
This Python script combines a palindrome checker with a simple arithmetic calculator. The user can input strings or numbers, and the script will determine if they are palindromes. Additionally, the user can perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers and check if the result is a palindrome. 

## Features:

    Palindrome Checker: The script checks if the user's input (string or number) is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backward.

    Arithmetic Calculator: The user can perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind creating this project was to provide a useful tool for checking palindromes and performing arithmetic calculations. The script serves as a learning exercise and demonstrates various concepts in Python programming, such as user input, conditionals, functions amd error handling.

## Usage

    Run the script: Execute the Python script in your terminal or IDE. For example: python script_name.py.

    Palindrome Check: Enter a string or number when prompted. The script will inform you whether the input is a palindrome or not.

    Arithmetic Calculation: To perform an arithmetic calculation, enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) when prompted. The script will provide the result of the operation and check if the result is a palindrome.

    Exit: To exit the program, type "exit" when prompted for input.

# Examples:

    Palindrome Check:
        Input: rise to vote sir
        Output: Oops!, 'rise to vote sir' is not a palindrome.
        Output: Congratulations!, 'risetovotesir' is a palindrome.
        

    Arithmetic Calculation:
        Input: Enter the first number: 5
        Input: Enter arithmetic operator(+, -, *, /): *
        Input: Enter the second number: 6
        Output: The result of 5 * 6 is 30
        Output: '30' is not a palindrome. You got this!

## Note

    The script handles invalid input and gracefully continues execution.
    The script handles spaces in the input and performs the palindrome check or arithmetic operation without considering spaces.
